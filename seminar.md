### Instructor:    
- **Mochizai Shuichi Sensei (Hanshi 8th dan)** assisted by Kokusai Renmei instructors from North America  

**Improve your iaido.** Attending a seminar is one of the best ways to sharpen your skills in iaido. For those of you who have been away from iaido for a while, it is also the best way to catch up. You will have the opportunity to learn from Mochizai Sensei, exactly the same as when visiting Japan. Attending the seminar will help you to reinforce correct techniques and will give a new or different perspective on what you can improve upon. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to benefit from the skill and wisdom of Mochizai Sensei.

**Accommodations:**    
- There are a few hotels in Alameda, some are on [the Alameda (main) island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_(island)) (ZIP code 94501), but there is also [Bay Farm island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Farm_Island,_Alameda,_California) (ZIP code 94502), which is close to Oakland airport.    
- Also take a look at [airbnb.com](https://www.airbnb.com/)
- Other possibilities could be the neighboring cities, in particular, Oakland, Emeryville, and Berkeley.    
- Consider travel distances to Alameda High School when booking your accommodations.    
- You can get a good sense of time required if you use Google maps or similar.    

**Access:**    
- **By car:** if you are driving, there should be no problem finding street parking nearby. There is also the school's parking lot, but we are not exactly sure yet if we are allowed to use it.
- **By public transportation:** there are several [AC transit](https://www.actransit.org/) buses that have stops within walking distance from Alameda High School: [19](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/19), [20](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/20), [51A](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/51A). In case you are coming from San Francisco or East Bay, you can take [BART](https://www.bart.gov/) to either Oakland 12th St station or to Fruitvale station and transfer to a local bus (19, 20, 51A). Another possibility from downtown San Francisco is to take a Transbay bus [O](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/O), [OX](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/OX), or [W](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/W), which can take you to Alameda. In case you are staying on Bay Farm island, take a look at buses [21](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/21) and [OX](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/OX), but these might be less frequent than others. Again, check Google maps or similar for exact directions. There is also [AC Transit Mobile app](https://www.actransit.org/app) which is very useful since it shows all bus stops and real time bus positions.
