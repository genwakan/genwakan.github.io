**We invite you to attend.** Everyone is welcome at the seminar. Whether you are new to iaido or have many years of experience, whether you practice regularly or are looking for a great way to get back into iaido, or whether you are from a different martial art, style, or organization, we invite you and welcome you to attend this unique and special iaido seminar. We look forward to seeing you.

**Improve your iaido.** Attending a seminar is one of the best ways to sharpen your skills in iaido. For those of you who have been away from iaido for a while, it is also the best way to catch up. You will have the opportunity to learn from Mochizai Sensei, exactly the same as when visiting Japan. Attending the seminar will help you to reinforce correct techniques and will give a new or different perspective on what you can improve upon. We encourage everyone to take this opportunity to benefit from the skill and wisdom of Mochizai Sensei.

**Accommodations:**
- There are a few hotels in Alameda, some are on [the Alameda (main) island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alameda_(island)) (ZIP code 94501), but there is also [Bay Farm island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Farm_Island,_Alameda,_California) (ZIP code 94502), which is close to Oakland airport.    
- Also take a look at [airbnb.com](https://www.airbnb.com/)
- Other possibilities could be the neighboring cities, in particular, Oakland, Emeryville, and Berkeley.    
- Consider travel distances to Alameda High School when booking your accommodations.    
- You can get a good sense of time required if you use Google maps or similar.    

**Access:**
- **By car:** if you are driving, there should be no problem finding street parking nearby. There is also the school's parking lot, but we are not exactly sure yet if we are allowed to use it.
- **By public transportation:** there are several [AC transit](https://www.actransit.org/) local buses that have stops within walking distance from Alameda High School: [**19**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/19), [**20**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/20), [**51A**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/51A). In case you are coming from San Francisco or someplace East Bay, you can take [**BART**](https://www.bart.gov/) to either Oakland 12th St station or to Fruitvale station and transfer to a local bus (19, 20, 51A). Another possibility from San Francisco is to take a Transbay bus [**O**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/O), [**OX**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/OX), or [**W**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/W), all of which can take you to Alameda from downtown San Francisco. In case you are staying on Bay Farm island, buses [**21**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/21) and [**OX**](https://www.actransit.org/bus-lines-schedules/OX) go between Bay Farm and main island, but possibly not as frequent as buses that serve main island. Again, check Google maps or similar for exact directons.
